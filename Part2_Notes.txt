a Rendering a collection, modules

    - Use map function to insert our <li> <\li>  
        - all JavaScript code in JSX has to be wrapped in {}

    - The list items, generated by the map method, must each have a unique key value: an attribute called key 
        - keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed 
        - we can simply use the array indexes as the keys 
            - a little like enumerate() in python

                const Note = ({ note }) => {
                    return (
                        <li>{note.content}</li>
                    )
                }

                <ul>
                    {notes.map((note, i) => 
                    <Note key={i} note={note} />
                    )}
                </ul>

    - Refactor code to compartmentalize and make things easier to navigate 

    Notes:  
        - following are the same: 
        
        const total = parts.map(x => x.exercises).reduce((s, p) => {return s + p}, 0)
        const total = parts.reduce(function(s, p) { return s + p.exercises}, 0)
